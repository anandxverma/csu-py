# This program calculates when the alarm will go off
# based on the current hr as provided by the user and
# the number of hrs to set the future alarm

# Ask the user to input the current hr in 24hr format
INPUT current_time_in_hrs

# Ask the user to input the number of hrs to set the future alarm
INPUT hrs_to_wait_for_alarm

# Calculate the future alarm time
total_hrs_to_wait = current_time_in_hrs + hrs_to_wait_for_alarm
# Calculate the number of days and hrs to wait for the alarm
num_days_to_wait = total_hrs_to_wait // 24
num_hrs_to_wait = total_hrs_to_wait % 24

# Print the results
DISPLAY The alarm will go off in num_days_to_wait days at num_hrs_to_wait hr
