# Program to calculate the total cost of a meal
# Provided the meal price, calculates the total cost by adding the tip and tax

# Define Constant Values for Tip and Tax rates
TIP_RATE = 18%
TAX_RATE = 7%

# Ask the user to input the meal price
INPUT meal_price_variable

# Calculate the tip amount
# Note: tip is calculated on the pre-tax amount
tip_variable = meal_price_variable * TIP_RATE

# Calculate the tax amount
tax_variable = meal_price_variable * TAX_RATE

# Calculate total cost
total_cost_variable = meal_price_variable + tip_variable + tax_variable

# Display the results
DISPLAY Tip amount = tip_variable
DISPLAY Tax amount = tax_variable
DISPLAY Total cost = total_cost_variable
